# PCIC React Leaflet Components

An `npm`-installable package of PCIC-developed 
[React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/en) 
components for use across projects.

Note: This README duplicates information in code comments, and may be out
of sync with them. It should be replaced by documentation generated from 
comments, but that is a future project.

## Installation

This package is not published to a Node package registry.
Instead, it is installed directly from GitHub, as follows:

Using HTTPS protocol (preferred):
```bash
npm install git+https://git@github.com/pacificclimate/pcic-react-leaflet-components.git#<version>
```

Using SSH protocol (requires troublesome ssh setup):
```bash
npm install git+ssh://git@github.com/pacificclimate/pcic-react-leaflet-components.git#<version>
```

From there, `pcic-react-leaflet-components` is like any other installed package,
and components are imported in JS code the usual way:

```js
import { ExampleComponent } from 'pcic-react-leaflet-components';
```

## Package contents

### `BCBaseMap`

Establishes a map of B.C. in the BC Albers projection, and nothing more.

Renders its children inside the Map.

### `YNWTBaseMap`

Establishes a map of the Yukon and NWT in the Yukon Albers projection, 
and nothing more.

Renders its children inside the Map.

## Contributing and "publishing"

We put the term "publishing" in quotes because we don't publish to a
Node registry, we just push package contents to GitHub and `npm install`
the package directly from GitHub. (See Installation above.)

Important:

* Only content under the `src/lib` subtree 
  is included in the package that is built. 

* Content outside the `src/lib` subtree is excluded from the package,
  but is allowed and can be extremely useful; for example, to
  create demonstrations of package content (see `src/demo` subtree).

* Each item exported by the package must be exported in the file 
  `src/lib/index.js`.

### Publishing and releasing

When you modify this package (i.e., when you modify the contents of the 
`src/lib` subtree), follow this procedure:

1. Make sure you export any new or renamed components in `src/lib/index.js`.

1. When all modifications have been completed, commit the code.

1. On the command line, `npm run build`. 

   A successful build will output something like the following:

    ```text
    > pcic-react-leaflet-components@0.1.0 build /home/rglover/code/pcic-react-leaflet-components
    > rimraf dist && NODE_ENV=production babel src/lib --out-dir dist --copy-files --ignore __tests__,spec.js,test.js,__snapshots__
    
    Successfully compiled 3 files with Babel.
    ```

   A successful build on changed `src/lib` content will cause files in the `dist/` subtree to be modified. 

1. Commit the changes in `dist/`.

1. Increment `version` in `package.json`.

1. Summarize the changes from the last version in `NEWS.md`.

1. Commit these changes, then tag the release, and push all to GitHub, including tag:

   ```bash
   git add package.json NEWS.md
   git commit -m "Bump to version x.x.x"
   git tag -a -m "x.x.x" x.x.x
   git push --follow-tags
   ```

## Package development framework

### Create React App

This package is developed using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
as the basis. To do this takes a little effort, but is worth it for the
following reasons:

1. All the out-of-box language and dev support benefits of Create React App:

   * React, JSX, ES6, TypeScript and Flow syntax support.

   * Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.

   * Autoprefixed CSS, so you donâ€™t need -webkit- or other prefixes.

   * A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.

   * A live development server that warns about common mistakes.

   * A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.

   * An offline-first service worker and a web app manifest, meeting all the Progressive Web App criteria. (Note: Using the service worker is opt-in as of react-scripts@2.0.0 and higher)

1. Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.

1. Easy to create demonstration apps for the components under development.

1. Familiarity.

1. Exact correspondence to our production environment 
(not that free-standing React components can or should depend much on the 
dev vs. prod environments, but ...).

### Adapting a Create React App project to package development

A CRA project is not an npm package, alas. Some adjustment is required.
Fortunately it is not too onerous.

After [reviewing a variety of ways](https://pcic.uvic.ca/confluence/display/CSG/Creating+an+npm+package+of+React+components+using+create-react-app) 
to adapt a Create React App project to package development, 
we chose what appears to be the simplest, implemented through
[`create-component-lib`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-component-lib).

With a small amount of tweaking, this worked out.
